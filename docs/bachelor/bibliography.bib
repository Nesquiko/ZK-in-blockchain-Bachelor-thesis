Our protocols make use of a blockchain platform to run in a permissionless manner, where anyone can contribute randomness in exchange for paying the requisite transaction fees. The resulting SRS is secure as long as any single party participates honestly. We introduce several protocols optimized for different sized powers-of-tau setups and using an on-chain or off-chain data availability model to store the resulting string. We implement our most efficient protocol on top of Ethereum, demonstrating practical concrete performance.",

    abstract = {Stealth address has been an effective way to protect privacy of users in blockchain. However, most of the existing schemes either require their users to bear extra storage costs to manage keys, or need one more private communication before each transaction. To overcome these drawbacks, we proposed a new kind of stealth addresses scheme in which a user only needs to keep a single key pair for initial certificate, the user only stores his or her initial key pair for all transactions. In our scheme, when a sender initiates a transaction, he or she creates a one-time transaction address, then the sender attaches it to the transaction. The receiver uses his or her private key to check the transaction from the blockchain, no private channel is needed for each transaction. Considering regulatory issues, transactions can be wholly or partially regulated, depending on security requirements. Finally, we provide provable security analysis to ensure the security of our scheme, and our simulation results show that our scheme is also efficient and practical in computation.},
