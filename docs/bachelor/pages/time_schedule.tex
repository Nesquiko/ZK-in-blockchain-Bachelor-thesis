The beginning of this work started in different direction. First application of
ZKPs in the ZK-EVM or in ZK-Rollups was being researched and considered. However,
after discussion with supervisor, these themes were considered too advanced and
a more suitable theme for Stealth Addresses with ZKP was chosen. The remainder
of the winter semester was split between researching how a stealth address scheme
with ZKPs can be designed and implemented, and then the solution design was proposed.

Start of the summer semester was more focused on learning CIRCOM for implementing
the a circuit needed to generate and verify ZKPs. Then the main part of the semester
was spent implementing the ZKP circuit, implementing set of smart contracts
and finally a proof of concept browser wallet supporting implemented scheme.
Last four weeks were spent on testing, fixing bugs and revising this document.
