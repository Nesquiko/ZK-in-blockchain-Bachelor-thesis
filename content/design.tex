\chapter{Solution Desing}

The Solution Design section outlines the design of a stealth address
scheme using ZKPs for the Ethereum blockchain. The scenario which is being
solved involves Alice, who wishes to send funds to Bob discreetly, ensuring no
one else can identify Bob as the recipient. This part of the thesis details
the application of ZKPs employed to achieve this privacy, allowing Alice to
complete the transaction without compromising Bob's identity.

\section{Initial Setup}

Before Alice can send funds to Bob, Bob must first publish his meta stealth
address to some public location. Bob generates:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A private key $k$
	\item A corresponding public key $K$
	\item A secret value $x$
	\item A hash of the secret value $h = hash(x)$
\end{itemize}

Bob then publishes his meta stealth address in the form of a tuple $(K, h)$.
The hash is later used to prove to a stealth address contract that Bob is the
owner of the address and can spend funds sent to it.
