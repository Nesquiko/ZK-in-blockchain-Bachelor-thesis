    The polynomial zero test is at the heart of the SNARK construction. Given a
    polynomial $f \in \mathbb{F}_p^{\leq d}[X]$, the probability that a random
    element $x \in \mathbb{F}_p$ is a root of $f$ is $d/p$.

    \[ \Pr[f(x) = 0] \leq \frac{d}{p} \]

    For example, $p = 2^{256}$ and $d = 2^{32}$, the probability that a random
    element $x \in \mathbb{F}_p$ is a root of $f$ is $2^{224}$. This is a negligible
    probability, and we can assume that $f$ is zero polynomial with high
    probability when $f(x) = 0$ for a random $x \in \mathbb{F}_p$.

    The generalization of the polynomial zero test for multivariate polynomials is
    known as \textit{SZDL lemma} \cite{Schwartz1980,Zippel1979,Demillo1978}.

    This can be used to prove that two polynomials are equal. Given two polynomials
    $f, g$, we can evaluate $h = f - g$ at a random point $x$. If $h(x) = 0$, then
    $f(x) - g(x) = 0 \Longrightarrow f(x) = g(x) \Longrightarrow f = g$ with high probability.
